Assignment 3
Recursive definitions and functions

In this assignment students will write several functions that
recursively process numbers.  In class we provided two recursive
definitions of numbers.  The recursive definitions provide a set
of constructors which capture the ways to construct a number.
Peano numbers have two constructors, one of which, succ, is recursive,
and Binary Numbers have three constructors, two of which, double and
double-plus1 are recursive.

1)  Peano arithmetic

    In words:  A number is either zero, or, recursively, the successor
    of a number is a number.

    Formally:  Number := zero|(succ Number)

2)  Binary arithmetic

    In words:  A binary number is either zero, or recursively, doubling
    a number or doubling a number and adding one gives a binary number.

    Formally:  BinNumber := zero|(double BinNumber)|(double-plus1 BinNumber)

    We can interpret binary numbers by assigning zero to the number zero
    and if b is the value of a binary number than (double b) has value 2*b
    and (double-plus1 b) has value 2*b+1.

    Note that there is more than one way to construct binary numbers with
    the same value.  E.G.  (double zero) has the same value as zero.
    A binary number is normalized if (double zero) is recursively replaced
    by zero, i.e. trailing zeros are removed.

    When recursively processing either types of numbers, you must
    handle cases corresponding to the different constructors.  Recursive
    calls must have inputs whose size is smaller, where size is the
    number of constructors needed to build the number.

    In the first part of this assignment you will write recursive
    functions to subtract and divide Peano numbers.  You will also
    implement the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common
    divisor, gcd, of Peano numbers.

    In the second part of this assignment you will write recursive functions
    to add and multiply Binary numbers using the recursive definition above.

Part I.  Peano arithmetic.

Question 1.  Implement subtraction of Peano numbers.  See specification
             below.

Question 2 & 3.  Implement division of Peano numbers.  Implement functions to
             compute the quotient and remainder when dividing Peano numbers
             m and n.  I.E. compute q the quotient and r the remainder
             such that m = q*n + r with 0 <= r < n.  See specification
             below.

             Your division and remainder functions should work directly with
             Peano-style representations.  While it would be possible to
             implement these operations by constructing conversion functions that
             convert a number to and from decimal notation, then using the built-in
             Racket numerical operations,  you should not use this path since it doesn't show that you understand how to
             perform those operations on your own.

Question 4. Implement a function to compute the greatest common divisor
             of the Peano numbers m and n.  g = gcd(m,n) satisfies
             1)  g is a common divisor of m and n.
                 g divides m and g divides n.  I.E. the remainder when
                 dividing m and n by g is 0.
             2)  g is the greatest common divisor.
                 If e divides m and e divides n then e must divide g.

             The standard algorithm for computing the gcd, the famous
             Euclidean algorithm can be implemented either with a loop or
             recursively  The recursive version uses this reasoning:
             1)  gcd(m,0) = m
             2)  gcd(m,n) = gcd(n,remainder of m divided by n).

             Your implementation of the gcd should use your Peano-arithmetic
             implementations from questions 2 and 3.

Part II.  Binary arithmetic.

Question 5.  Implement a recursive function to add two binary numbers
(non-negative integers using the D/DP1 representation).  Your
implementation should work directly on the D/DP1/zero lists that
represent the numbers.  The number of recursive calls should be at
most to the number of symbols in the lists.  For example, in lab 4,
you discovered that (binadd (D A) (D B)) is always (regardless of what
A and B are) (D (binadd A B)).  So if your binadd function
implementation is processing its two operands and finds that they are
both lists whose first element is D, you can implement the addition in
that case as one recursive call to binadd, not (D B) or (D A)
recursive calls involving inc or dec.  Such efficient processing will
process numbers one symbol at a time.  Since there are only
log-base-two(N)+1 symbols needed to represent the number N (for N>= 1,
or 1 symbol to represent zero), this is a more efficient way of doing
the addition.  For example, consider the number N= 1024.  Only eleven
symbols (not counting parentheses) are needed to represent N in D/DP1
notation, so processing N when it is in that form should take only 11
and not 1024 recursive calls.

Question 6.  Implement a recursive function to multiply two binary
numbers (non-negative integers working directly on the D/DP1
representation).  If you are doing things properly you won't need any
calls to dec or inc, just binadd and recursive calls to binmult and
basic list operations.
